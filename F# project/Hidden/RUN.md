# How to Run the Project

## Quick Solution

You're currently in: `F# project` directory  
You need to be in: `F# project/F# project` directory (where the `.fsproj` file is)

## Option 1: Navigate to Project Directory (Recommended)

```bash
cd "F# project"
dotnet run
```

## Option 2: Run from Current Directory

From the `F# project` directory (where you are now), run:

```bash
dotnet run --project "F# project\F# project.fsproj"
```

**Note:** Use backslashes `\` on Windows, or forward slashes `/` - both work.

## Option 3: Use the Batch File

Double-click `run.bat` in the `F# project` folder, or run:

```bash
run.bat
```

## Verify You're in the Right Place

The project file should be at: `F# project/F# project/F# project.fsproj`

If you see this file, you're in the correct directory!
